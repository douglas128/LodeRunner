# LodeRunner

I try write loderunner with Unity . 
Now it contains tileCreator ,LodeRunerGraphBuilder(it charge of build the graph data ),pathFinding,too-Close Detection(when AI move,this is useful).
But I don't grasp the AI strategy writted by Douglas E. Smith. I think I need to understand the game more deep.

OnLine Demo(It can not run on mobile phone):https://googledrive.com/host/0BwjcBuNcVrmMWndjNEdZbnJ0NDQ
